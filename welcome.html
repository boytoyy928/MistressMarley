                <p>I don't mess around. This isn't a game.</p>
                <p>I'm superior, above you, in control, and always looking for more prey. BDSM is a part of life, and you need to understand that. Whether you are a novice, or experienced slave, you'll never be able to live up to my expectations. But keep trying, I enjoy watching you struggle and beg. </p>
                <p>By day I walk among New York's corporate elite. By night I am a Pro Dominatrix, and spend my time entertaining subs who think they can please. I've been in this life privately for many years now. Participating in events and kink parties, I was always the dominant one and center of attention, and nothing has changed.</p>
                <p>I've been in this life for many years now, and have met many men who thought they could handle me, only to find out they were nothing more than a disappointment. Think you're special or different? Lets find out.</p>
